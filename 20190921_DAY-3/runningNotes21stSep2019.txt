AWS Types of Resources :

    1. Global : IAM, Route53,
    2. Region : VPC, EC2 

    Part of AWS 22 Regions, We have access to 18 Regions --- 

    1. NV     : VPC & EC2 
    2. Mumbai : VPC & EC2

Default_VPC : 
1. Subnets
2. Security Groups
3. Network ACLs
4. VPN Attachments
5. Internet Gateways
6. Route Tables
7. Network Interfaces
8. VPC Peering Connections

NETFLIX : NV Region 

AWS Account - 18 Regions & each region consist of Default_VPC i.e. 

Custom VPC : 

PRIME : NV Region

Custom VPC : 


The first four IP addresses and the last IP address in each subnet CIDR block are not available for you to use, and cannot be assigned to an instance. For example, in a subnet with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, the following five IP addresses are reserved:

10.0.0.0: Network address.

10.0.0.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.

10.0.0.2: Reserved by AWS. The IP address of the DNS server is always the base of the VPC network range plus two; however, we also reserve the base of each subnet range plus two. For VPCs with multiple CIDR blocks, the IP address of the DNS server is located in the primary CIDR. For more information, see Amazon DNS Server.

10.0.0.3: Reserved by AWS for future use.

10.0.0.255: Network broadcast address. We do not support broadcast in a VPC, therefore we reserve this address.
